Hey Ruby community!

Last night I was tinkering around with some Quartz graphics and made a Ruby screen saver.

- \- [Grab it](/downloads/rubies-screensaver.zip)
- \- Drop it into ```~/Library/Screen\ Savers/```
- \- Go to System Preferences -> Desktop & Screen Saver -> Screen Saver
- \- Select the "Rubies" screen saver

Like it or want to get in touch? Let me know on Twitter or via the comments section.
