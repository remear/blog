### I'm not just a developer

Can a person really be happy at their job? As I pondered this question over several months, I have to admit that I was arriving at a conclusion of no. I had what I would call a good job. I made decent money. The benefits were all right. My bills were getting paid. I was living moderately comfortably. Something was lacking though. I began to notice I wasn't happy. I enjoy writing software. I feel fortunate to have my interests coincide with my profession. I very much enjoy being creative and taking pride in my work. That makes me happy. So why wasn't I?

I was working for a "closed" company. One in fact that practices stacked ranking. A company that prohibits contributing work back to open source projects. A company that places no value on developer involvement in feature planning and expects developers to just code what they ask for. One where all the credit for a successful feature addition would go to the project manager and all the blame for a problem or failure to the developer. Such an environment was crushing my creativity, and that is something I refuse to lose.


### Pursuing a creative outlet

My creativity is the core for everything I do. It's what motivates me. It's what drives me. I decided to retain my creativity by beginning work on a free-time project. This free-time project required a payments solution. I was looking for one with two specific features. First, allow charging user A and pay to user B without being a middle-man, a marketplace solution of sorts. Second, have the ability to debit bank accounts. I spent several months researching various payments solutions but results proved disappointing. Some only processed credit cards. Some had vague pricing. Some had horrible documentation. Most were generally very overcomplicated. Then I found Balanced.

What first caught my attention was the openness of Balanced. They had an IRC channel where I could get support directly from developers. They also used Github issues to openly discuss feature designs and prioritize them for implementation based on user interest. I inquired about ACH debit support and they said they didn't have the ability yet but that it was on the roadmap for the near future. Since I wasn't in a hurry, I decided to continue implementing Balanced into my application while they developed the feature I needed. I began by hanging around in the IRC channel asking questions here and there. I was impressed by the Balanced employee's helpfulness and politeness. In a short space of time I started to find the channel to be an enjoyable place to hang out. I appreciated the help I received in having my questions answered so I began answering questions in the channel as my ability permitted. This was often followed up by a series of appreciative remarks from several Balanced employees. Before I knew it, my creative outlet had become Balanced. It was like my second job, my fun job.

### I asked for a t-shirt

I really liked the direction Balanced was going and had a genuine desire to see them grow and become a leading player in the payments industry. I wanted to somehow be part of such a great company, be part of realizing their vision, be part of the Balanced legacy. I began to contribute to balanced-ruby, fixing issues here and there. While hanging out in IRC, a frequent question asked was if Balanced had an iOS library. The answer was always the same, not yet but we hope to have one soon. Since I work a lot with Objective-C and iOS applications, I saw the opportunity to contribute one and spent the next week of evenings creating [balanced-ios](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-ios). I can only imagine the incredulous surprise that must have ensued when I presented it to Balanced. They openly mentioned me in interviews and articles, thanking me for my work. For weeks they pestered me about paying me for my contributions. Each time I replied that it wasn't about the money, I contributed because I believe in Balanced and wanted to see it grow and succeed. They were relentless though so I asked if I could just have a Balanced t-shirt. They sent me 4.

### I got a job

Shortly after the first release of balanced-ios, I was asked if I wanted to work at Balanced. At the time Balanced had a strict no remote worker policy and reluctantly I had to decline because I couldn't move away from family. This didn't change my motivation though. Another few months passed. I started to see more requests for an Android library. So I made [balanced-android](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-android) over the course of a few evenings and gave it to Balanced. I'm not sure what made them rethink their policy, but Balanced again asked me to come work for them, this time to be their first remote worker. I'm now a full-time remote worker for Balanced. I'm loving every minute of it. I'm able to be creative and work on new things to make the payments industry better, especially for marketplaces. I asked for a t-shirt, I got a job and much more. I now believe, yes, a person really can enjoy their job.
